All .dta files are raw binary files.

(probe, hidden, valid) .dta are exactly what their name suggest.
First column is user index
Second column is movie index
Third is the rating.
Forth is the date.

The qual.dta is the set we are going to test.
It only has 3 column. (user, movie, date), no rating.

The training set is divided into 4 parts
user.dta
movie.dta
rating.dta
date.dta

If you combine the ith entry of each file into a tuple, you get exactly the ith (user, movie, rating, date) tuple in the input.
Notice the tuples are ordered according to movie index.

The movie_a.dta is the average rating of all movies, sorted by movie index

The user_a.dta is the average rating given by each user, sorted by user index
 
And have fun.
